> Chris Evans | Website Designer & SEO Consultant<br><br>
> Excellent – lots of options, but still easy to use<br>
> Thanks a lot for this plugin! It bridges a rather large gap between completely preconfigured form plugins that lack essential fields, and more complex plugins that are very difficult for beginners to figure out. The built-in preview of the form as you are building is very helpful, and it has a really nice range of field type options and style settings, which are named in a more user-friendly way than most. Also, the drag and drop works smoothly and easily without any funky bugginess.<br>
